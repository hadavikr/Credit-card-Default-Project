# Credit-card-Default-Project

The purpose of this project is to conduct quantitative analysis on credit card default risk by applying 4 classification machine learning models. Despite machine learning and big data have been adopted by the banking industry, the current applications are mainly focused on credit score predicting. Heavily relying on credit scores could cause banks to miss valuable customers who are new immigrants with repaying power but little to no credit history. This analysis is a machine learning application on default risk itself and the predictor features do not include credit score or credit history. Due to the regulatory constraints that banks are facing.
In these 4 models, if the firm expects high recall, then random forest and xgboost classifier models are the best candidate. If the balance of recall and precision is the most important metric, then Random Forest is the ideal model.
To identify the default payment of credit card clients of huge data set data analysis should be involved. Data analysis allows cultivation and learning based on model build, feature extraction, and various conditions that can improve the trait of customer acquirement. The four machine learning techniques mentioned can analysis the huge data set and to provide the accurate result. XGBoost provided us the best results.
